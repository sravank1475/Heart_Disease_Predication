# Heart-Disease-Predictor-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks

## Abstract

 Deep neural networks are powerful and popular algorithms in this era. Understanding the architecture and how neural network learn remains one of the central challenges in deep learning research. A lot of their success lays in the careful design of the neural network architecture. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are essential tools in deep learning that are increasingly used for building computational models in neuroscience. In this paper we will come across complete architecture of artificial neural networks. Here, we study the emergence of structure in the weights and activation functions by applying methods from topological data analysis. We train simple feedforward neural networks on a Heart Disease dataset then monitor the evolution of the weights and the essence of backpropagation technique. In this study, a Heart Disease Prediction System (HDPS) is developed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm for predicting the risk level of heart disease. The system uses 13 medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity for prediction. The HDPS predicts the likelihood of patients getting heart disease. The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart diseases.Also detailed how to customize the analysis, structure, and learning of ANNs to better address a wide range of challenges in AI.For better understanding and hands-on experience, this Primer is accompanied with tutorial-style code in TensorFlow along with Pycharm and Jupyter Notebook IDE, covering major topics.


## Problem_Statement

   Heart disease can be managed effectively with a combination of lifestyle changes, medicine and, in some cases, surgery. With the right treatment, the symptoms of heart disease can be reduced and the functioning of the heart improved. The predicted results can be used to prevent and thus reduce cost for surgical treatment and other expensive.
   There are instruments available which can predict heart disease but either they are expensive or are not efficient to calculate chance of heart disease in human. Early detection of cardiac diseases can decrease the mortality rate and overall complications. However, it is not possible to monitor patients every day in all cases accurately and consultation of a patient for 24 hours by a doctor is not available since it requires more sapience, time and expertise. Since we have a good amount of data in todayâ€™s world, we can use various machine learning or deep learning algorithms to analyze the data for hidden patterns. The hidden patterns can be used for health diagnosis in medicinal data.
